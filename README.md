# Crime-Chronicles-Inflation-in-the-Golden-State
Project 1: Investigating the possible connections between inflation and fluctuations in crime activity within California.



## Project Overview
The overall purpose of this project was to investigate as to whether there was a correlation between fluctuations in inflation and fluctuations with crime within California over a 25 year time period (1998 - 2023). The data used in this investigation consisted of the crimes reported from the California Department of Justice, as well as the inflation rates of those years collected from Investopedia. We would begin first by investigating how crime overall has fluctuated througout the 25 year time period, and then break them down into distinct crime categories (Violent, Larceny, and Property). From these three categories, we would then investigate how each changed over time, and then compare these trends to the changes in inflation throughout the years. 

## Resources
The data collected on crime statistics from the years 1998 to 2023 was obtained from Open Justice - California Department of Justice and detailed the crimes broken down into categories and their respective counts each year.

The data collected on inflation rates in the United States from the years 1998 to 2023 was obtained from Investopedia which detailed the inflation rates, as well the events that were believed to contribute to these rates, for each year from 1998 to 2023.
